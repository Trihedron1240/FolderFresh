# FolderFresh Roadmap

FolderFresh is actively maintained and under development. Here's what's coming next.

## Version 3.0 - Complete Rebuild (In Progress)

FolderFresh 3.0 is a ground-up rewrite focused on performance, cross-platform support, and powerful new features.

### Core Architecture
- **New Tech Stack**: Migrating from Python/PyQt to C#/WinUI with Uno Platform
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows, Linux, macOS support out of the box
- **Performance**: Faster file operations and improved responsiveness
- **Modern UI**: Complete redesign with native platform integration

### Enhanced Trust Ceremony
Building on the preview system that makes FolderFresh safe to use:
- **Live Preview Mode**: See exactly what will happen before committing changes
- **Temporary Directory Structures**: Explore the future state of your files
- **Risk-Free Testing**: Try organization strategies without fear

### Major New Feature: AI-Powered Rule Generation

**The Problem**: Creating complex rules manually can be intimidating, even with a powerful rule engine.

**The Solution**: Natural language rule creation powered by AI.

#### How It Works
1. Describe what you want in plain English: *"Move all documents containing finance terms to my invoices folder, sorted by date"*
2. AI analyzes your request and generates FolderFresh rules
3. Preview shows exactly what those rules will do (trust ceremony!)
4. Accept, edit, or refine the generated rules
5. Rules become part of your permanent configuration

#### Key Features
- **Local-first processing**: Privacy-focused, runs on your machine
- **Clarification conversations**: AI asks questions until it understands exactly what you want
- **Transparent rules**: You see and control the actual rules, not black-box AI decisions
- **Learning tool**: Understand the rule engine by seeing AI-generated examples
- **Content-aware**: Reads document contents to make intelligent categorization decisions

This isn't AI that moves files around mysteriously - it's AI that teaches you to create powerful automation rules.
