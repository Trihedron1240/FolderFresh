FolderFresh — One-Click Desktop Cleaner (Windows)

FolderFresh is a small tool that organises messy folders automatically.

It sorts files into simple categories such as Documents, Images, Videos, Audio, Archives, Code, and Other. Nothing is deleted, and the process can be reversed at any time.

How it works:

Select a folder (Desktop, Downloads, or any other location).

Click Preview to see exactly what will be moved and where.

Click Organise Files to tidy everything into subfolders.

Example structure after cleaning:

Desktop  ├─ Documents  ├─ Images  ├─ Videos  ├─ Audio  ├─ Archives  └─ Other 

Safety features

Preview mode shows the plan before anything moves.

Safe Mode copies files instead of moving them.

Undo puts all files back in their original locations.

Files inside program or game directories are not touched, to avoid breaking software.

Who it’s for:

People who want a clean Desktop or Downloads folder without manually dragging files around. 
Useful for students, general Windows users, and anyone who tends to accumulate clutter.
